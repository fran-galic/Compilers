# Programming Language Translation - Laboratory Exercises

This repository contains solutions for the laboratory exercises from the course **Programming Language Translation**, which focuses on the processes of hierarchical translation of programming languages. The course covers lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis, as well as code generation, with an emphasis on building compilers and interpreters for simple programming languages.

The course is part of the undergraduate Computer Science program at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER).

## About the Course

The course explores the principles and techniques of translating high-level programming languages into machine code or intermediate representations. Key topics include:
- **Lexical analysis**: Tokenization of source code.
- **Syntactic analysis**: Parsing and constructing syntax trees.
- **Semantic analysis**: Type checking and scope resolution.
- **Code generation**: Translating intermediate representations into executable code.

The goal is to understand the entire pipeline of a compiler or interpreter, from source code to execution.

## Laboratory Exercises

### 1. **Lexical Analysis**
The first lab focuses on implementing a **lexical analyzer** for a simple programming language called **PJ**. The task involves tokenizing source code into a sequence of tokens (e.g., keywords, identifiers, operators) based on predefined language rules.

---

### 2. **Syntactic Analysis**
The second lab focuses on implementing a **syntactic analyzer (parser)** for the **PJ** language. The task involves building an **LL(1) parser** that constructs a parse tree from the sequence of tokens generated by the lexical analyzer, ensuring the input conforms to the language's grammar.

---

### 3. **Semantic Analysis**
The third lab focuses on implementing a **semantic analyzer** for the **PJ** language. The task involves checking variable declarations, scope resolution, and ensuring all variables are defined before use, while detecting errors such as undeclared variables.

---

### 4. **Code Generation**
The fourth lab focuses on implementing a **code generator** for the **PJ** language. The task involves translating the intermediate representation of the program into **mnemonic code** for the **FRISC processor**, ensuring the generated code is executable and produces correct results.
